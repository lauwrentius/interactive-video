2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.520
[Mobile Expert] I'm glad you
came in, Michelle. 

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.440
Do you have an old phone
you'd like to trade in? 

4
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.400
[Customer] I have an iPhone,
which is about two-years-old. 

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.000
So, my friend got a new one 

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.080
and it seems pretty cool.

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.250
[Mobile Expert] They are amazing. 

8
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.330
Hey, let's take a look at
the newest ones together. 

9
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.670
We can get you set up right away.

10
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.010


11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.920
[Mobile Expert] Happy you're here, Michelle. 

12
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.960
We'd love to have
you join T-Mobile; 

13
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.470
let's make that happen. 

14
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.210
Do you have a little
time right now 

15
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.210
to look at some devices? 

16
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.630
[Customer] Yeah, I've got a few minutes.

17
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.350
[Mobile Expert] Ok. Do you already
have something in mind? 

18
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.380
[Customer] Kinda.
I want to see prices 

19
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.300
and get an idea
of what you have.

20
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.350
[Mobile Expert] Ok. Can you tell me 

21
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.350
how you use your current
device most of the time? 

22
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.060
This way I can help you
explore your options 

23
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.190
and find a device with
the features you want.

24
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.980


25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.730
[Mobile Expert VO] Let's review how you can have great two-way conversations.

26
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.040
When a customer is new to you 

27
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.450
or your store you only
have a few seconds 

28
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.320
to make a great first impression. 

29
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.290
Be friendly and approachable, 

30
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.240
and use questions to learn
about your customer.

31
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.210
Ask about their current wireless experience: 

32
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.580
What do they like? 

33
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.840
What don't they like? 

34
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.500
Listen and pick up on information
that will help you explain 

35
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.090
Why T-Mobile in ways
that are meaningful to them.

36
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.170
Use open questions to find out 

37
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.720
what matters most to your customer 

38
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.140
so you can make recommendations 

39
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.900
that are personal
and matched to their needs.

40
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.780
This kind of two-way
conversation can reduce, 

41
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.380
or even eliminate potential hesitations.

42
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.200


43
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.860
[Customer] I'd like to
learn a little more. 

44
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.390
Can you explain the details?

45
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.360
[Mobile Expert] Of course. 

46
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.880
With T-Mobile One you've
got a lot of great options.

47
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.160
[Director] And cut! 

48
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.070
Alright let's take five.

49
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.360
[Chatter]

50
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.511
