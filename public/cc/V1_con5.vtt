00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.980
[Mobile Expert VO] Let's review how you can have great two-way conversations.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.930
When a customer is new to you 

4
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.310
or your store you only
have a few seconds 

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.180
to make a great first impression. 

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.950
Be friendly and approachable, 

7
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.530
and use questions to learn
about your customer.

8
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.810
Ask about their current wireless experience: 

9
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.040
What do they like? 

10
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.580
What don't they like? 

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.190
Listen and pick up on information
that will help you explain 

12
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.660
Why T-Mobile in ways
that are meaningful to them.

13
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.840
Use open questions to find out 

14
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.510
what matters most to your customer 

15
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.880
so you can make recommendations 

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.350
that are personal
and matched to their needs.

17
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.580
This kind of two-way
conversation can reduce, 

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.980
or even eliminate potential hesitations.

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.360


20
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.770
[Customer] I'd like to
learn a little more. 

21
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.090
Can you explain the details?

22
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.810
[Mobile Expert] Of course. 

23
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.230
With T-Mobile One you've
got a lot of great options.

24
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.020
[Director] And cut! 

25
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.580
Alright let's take five.

26
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.910
[Chatter]

27
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.212
