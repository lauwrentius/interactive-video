00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090
[Mobile Expert] Happy you're here, Michelle. 

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.970
We'd love to have
you join T-Mobile; 

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.810
let's make that happen. 

4
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.070
Do you have a little
time right now 

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.400
to look at some devices? 

6
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.850
[Customer] Yeah, I've got a few minutes.

7
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.450
[Mobile Expert] Ok. Do you already
have something in mind? 

8
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.740
[Customer] Kinda.
I want to see prices 

9
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.330
and get an idea
of what you have.

10
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.450
[Mobile Expert] Ok. Can you tell me 

11
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.240
how you use your current
device most of the time? 

12
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.230
This way I can help you
explore your options 

13
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.980
and find a device with
the features you want.

14
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.130


15
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.760
[Mobile Expert] I'm glad you
came in, Michelle. 

16
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.830
We'd love to have you join T-Mobile; 

17
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.460
let's make that happen.

18
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.460
Can you tell me how your
current carrier is working for you?

19
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.930
[Customer] Not well.

20
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.330
 It seems like my bill is
different every month. 

21
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410
I'm managing my data
and it's complicated.

22
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.440
[Mobile Expert] Nobody should
have to deal with that, 

23
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.840
and with T-Mobile
you won't have to, 

24
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.560
because we're all unlimited. 

25
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.100
Everything is included with
our T-Mobile One plan, 

26
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.610
so there are no surprises, 

27
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.160
which makes our
pricing simple and easy.

28
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.840
[Customer] That sounds awesome, 

29
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.140
and way better than what
I'm dealing with now.

30
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.360
[Mobile expert] That's the idea. 

31
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.820
Now, about your device,
tell me how you use it. 

32
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.770
Are you watching videos,
taking pictures?

33
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.200
[Customer] I take a lot of photos. 

34
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.200
I'm, like, the queen of selfies.

35
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800
[Mobile Expert] Me too!
