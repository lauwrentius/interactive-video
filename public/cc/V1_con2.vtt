00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
[Mobile Expert] I'm glad you
came in, Michelle. 

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.990
We'd love to have you join T-Mobile; 

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.630
let's make that happen.

4
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.030
Can you tell me how your
current carrier is working for you?

5
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.350
[Customer] Not well.

6
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.740
 It seems like my bill is
different every month. 

7
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm managing my data
and it's complicated.

8
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.690
[Mobile Expert] Nobody should
have to deal with that, 

9
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.230
and with T-Mobile
you won't have to, 

10
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.980
because we're all unlimited. 

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.820
Everything is included with
our T-Mobile One plan, 

12
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.120
so there are no surprises, 

13
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.580
which makes our
pricing simple and easy.

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.360
[Customer] That sounds awesome, 

15
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.620
and way better than what
I'm dealing with now.

16
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.840
[Mobile expert] That's the idea. 

17
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.260
Now, about your device,
tell me how you use it. 

18
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.170
Are you watching videos,
taking pictures?

19
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.550
[Customer] I take a lot of photos. 

20
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.460
I'm, like, the queen of selfies.

21
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.319
[Mobile Expert] Me too!
