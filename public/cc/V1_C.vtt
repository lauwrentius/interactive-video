00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
[Mobile Expert] I'm glad you
came in, Michelle. 

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.210
We'd love to have you join T-Mobile; 

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.820
let's make that happen.

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.790
Can you tell me how your
current carrier is working for you?

5
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.100
[Customer] Not well.

6
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.770
 It seems like my bill is
different every month. 

7
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm managing my data
and it's complicated.

8
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.780
[Mobile Expert] Nobody should
have to deal with that, 

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.230
and with T-Mobile
you won't have to, 

10
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.910
because we're all unlimited. 

11
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.530
Everything is included with
our T-Mobile One plan, 

12
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.030
so there are no surprises, 

13
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.420
which makes our
pricing simple and easy.

14
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.220
[Customer] That sounds awesome, 

15
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.710
and way better than what
I'm dealing with now.

16
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.260
[Mobile expert] That's the idea. 

17
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.320
Now, about your device,
tell me how you use it. 

18
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.180
Are you watching videos,
taking pictures?

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840
[Customer] I take a lot of photos. 

20
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.720
I'm, like, the queen of selfies.

21
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.189
[Mobile Expert] Me too!
