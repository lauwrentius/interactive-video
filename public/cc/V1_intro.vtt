2
00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:11.450


3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.820
[Director] Okay, places people. 

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.300
We're going be rolling
in just a few minutes.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.460
[Producer] So, I understand this 

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.990
interaction model video
is about Make it Personal 

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.650
and how Mobile Experts have
two-way conversations. Right?

8
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.700
[T-Mobile Rep] Exactly. 

9
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.120
Two-way conversations are how we 

10
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.410
deepen existing customer relationships 

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.130
and build new ones
with our customers. 

12
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.500
It's part of our Un-carrier culture!

13
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.450
[Production Assistant] Take one.

14
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.900
[Clap]

15
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.660
[Director] And action.

16
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.710
[Mobile Expert] I'm glad to
hear you've heard 

17
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580
so many good things about T-Mobile.

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.470
[Customer] Totally. 

19
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.460
My friend has been talking
you up for a long time;

20
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.140
I finally decided to come in
and see what's up.

21
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.270
[Mobile Expert] Oh, great.

22
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.630
[Mobile Expert VO] Hmmm, what
do you think should happen next?

23
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.680
Find out about the customer's device, 

24
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.830
so you can help
them choose a 

25
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.720
new one that is
right for them.

26
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.680
Find out about the customer's device,
current carrier, 

27
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.970
and what they are looking
to learn more about.

28
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.900
Find out about the customer's device 

29
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.610
and offer to help
them figure out what 

30
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.980
T-Mobile can do for them.

31
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.464
